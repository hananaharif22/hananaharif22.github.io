At the heart of “FabLab - MESCE” is digital manufacturing technology,
combininig 2D and 3D design with the latest fabrication technology. Embracing
a broad spectrum of methods ranging from CNC machining to 3D printing, and
even PCB Milling. It can produce a single unique product from a digital design
in a matter of minutes- and at a very low cost in comparison to traditional tooling
methods.


“FabLab - MESCE” also hosts a number other technologies and equipments
which provide broad manufacturing capability, including precision laser
. cutters and moulding and milling equipment through electronic
. components and circuit boards.


The only mini fablab in malabar area.

### 3D Printing

3D printing refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. STL is one of the most common file types that 3D printers can read. Thus, 3D printing builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.

### Laser Cutting

Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A typical commercial laser for cutting materials would involve a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas, leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials.

### Vinyl Cutting

A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).

A symbol / label can be produced using a Vinyl Cutter such as a ‘Sticker Machine’ or a ‘Craftrobo’. These machines are controlled by a computer and operate similar to a printer. Essentially they cut out shapes in adhesive vinyl. The vinyl can then be stuck onto almost any surface.[1]
